# Permit2 RPC Manager - Monorepo

This repository contains the code for the Permit2 RPC ecosystem, managed as a
monorepo.

## Packages

This monorepo includes the following packages:

- **`packages/permit2-rpc-server`**: A Deno Deploy service that acts as an
  intelligent, CORS-friendly proxy for EVM-compatible JSON-RPC requests. It
  automatically selects the fastest, valid RPC endpoint from a curated whitelist
  for each incoming request, handling fallback and caching internally. See the
  [server package README](./packages/permit2-rpc-server/README.md) for details
  on deployment and usage.
- **`packages/permit2-rpc-client`**: A lightweight TypeScript client SDK for
  easily interacting with the deployed `permit2-rpc-server` service from
  frontend applications or other JavaScript/TypeScript environments. See the
  [client package README](./packages/permit2-rpc-client/README.md) for
  installation and usage instructions.

## Core Features (Provided by the Server)

- **Automatic RPC Selection:** Dynamically tests whitelisted RPCs for latency,
  sync status (`eth_syncing`), and specific contract bytecode (Permit2 via
  `eth_getCode`) to find the best endpoint.
- **Robust Fallback:** Automatically iterates through ranked usable RPCs if the
  initial attempt fails.
- **Caching:** Uses Deno KV for server-side caching of test results.
- **CORS Enabled:** Handles CORS preflight requests and headers, allowing direct
  browser access.
- **Batch Request Support:** Accepts arrays of JSON-RPC requests for efficient
  data fetching.

## Development

This repository uses `bun` for managing root-level scripts and potentially
workspaces in the future.

- **Update Whitelist Source Data:** `bun run submodule:update` (Updates
  `lib/chainlist`)
- **Generate Whitelist JSON:** `bun run chainlist:generate` (Generates JSON in
  `lib/chainlist`)
- **Update Server Whitelist:** `bun run whitelist:update` (Copies generated JSON
  to the server package)
- **Test Whitelist Connectivity:** `bun run whitelist:test` (Tests URLs in the
  server package's whitelist)
- **Format Root:** `bun run format:root` (Formats root-level files with
  Prettier)

Development, building, testing, and running specific packages should be done
within their respective directories (`packages/permit2-rpc-server` or
`packages/permit2-rpc-client`). Refer to the README file within each package for
specific commands (e.g., `deno task start` for the server, `bun run build` for
the client).
