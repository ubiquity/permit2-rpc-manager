# Active Context: Permit2 RPC Monorepo (Server + Client)

## 1. Current Focus

The project has been restructured into a monorepo containing the Deno Deploy
proxy service (`packages/permit2-rpc-server`) and a new client SDK
(`packages/permit2-rpc-client`). Focus is now on finalizing documentation after
adding batch support and local testing capabilities.

## 2. Recent Activities & Findings

- **Monorepo Restructuring:**
  - Created `packages/` directory structure.
  - Moved server code to `packages/permit2-rpc-server`.
  - Created client SDK structure in `packages/permit2-rpc-client`.
  - Configured root `package.json` for workspaces.
  - Added `deno.jsonc` to server package.
  - Added `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` to client package.
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow path.
- **Server Enhancements:**
  - Implemented batch JSON-RPC request handling in `deno-server.ts`.
  - Fixed Deno KV access by using `--unstable-kv` flag in `deno.jsonc`.
  - Fixed `rpc-whitelist.json` import paths.
  - Removed unused `viem` dependency and related code (`contract-utils.ts`).
  - Added `disableCache` option (via `DISABLE_RPC_CACHE` env var) for testing.
- **Client SDK:**
  - Created basic implementation (`createRpcClient`, `request` method) wrapping
    `fetch`.
  - Set up build process using `bun build`.
- **Testing:**
  - Added integration tests (`client.test.ts`) for the client SDK using
    `bun test`.
  - Configured tests to read target URL from `TEST_TARGET_URL` env var.
  - Added root `package.json` scripts (`test:client:local`,
    `test:client:remote`) to facilitate testing against local or deployed
    server.
  - Successfully ran local tests (`bun run test:client:local`) after fixing
    server startup issues.
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated root `README.md` for monorepo structure.
  - Added package-specific `README.md` files.
  - Updated `docs/tech-context.md`, `docs/system-patterns.md`,
    `docs/product-context.md`.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Finalize Documentation:** Update `docs/progress.md` and `.clinerules`.
  (Current task)
- **Server Testing:** Implement proper tests for the Deno server package using
  `deno test`.
- **Client SDK Refinement:** Add more robust error handling, potentially
  automatic batching, and more tests to the client SDK.
- **Publishing:** Publish the `@ubiquity-dao/permit2-rpc-client` package to npm.
- **Abuse Prevention:** Consider implementing CORS origin restrictions or API
  keys for the deployed server.

## 4. Decisions Made & Considerations

- **Architecture:** Adopted a monorepo structure for managing the server and
  client together.
- **Caching:** Using Deno KV, fixed startup issues with `--unstable-kv`, added
  option to disable for testing.
- **Batch Support:** Added to the Deno server.
- **Client SDK:** Created as a separate package within the monorepo.
- **Testing:** Set up integration tests for the client SDK runnable against
  local or remote server. Server tests still needed.
