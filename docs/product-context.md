# Product Context: Permit2 RPC Proxy Service (Deno Deploy)

## 1. Problem Statement

Developers building decentralized applications (dApps) often need to interact
with various blockchain networks via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints
directly from the browser. This presents several challenges:

- **CORS Issues:** Browsers enforce Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  policies, preventing frontend applications from directly calling many public
  RPC endpoints that lack permissive CORS headers. This forces developers to
  route requests through their own backend, adding complexity.
- **Reliability:** Public RPC endpoints can be unreliable, experiencing
  downtime, rate limiting, or performance degradation. Building robust fallback
  logic on the frontend is difficult.
- **Performance:** The latency of RPC endpoints varies significantly. Frontend
  applications often cannot easily determine the fastest available endpoint for
  the user.
- **Complexity:** Managing multiple RPC URLs per chain and implementing
  selection/fallback logic directly in the frontend increases bundle size and
  development effort.

## 2. Proposed Solution

The Permit2 RPC Proxy Service, deployed on Deno Deploy, solves these problems by
providing an intelligent, CORS-friendly intermediary:

- **Solves CORS:** Acts as a backend proxy, eliminating browser CORS
  restrictions by handling the upstream RPC calls server-side and returning
  responses with appropriate CORS headers.
- **Abstracts Complexity:** Frontend applications only need to know the single
  proxy service URL (`https://<project>.deno.dev/rpc/{chainId}`). The service
  handles all the underlying RPC selection, testing, and fallback.
- **Smart Selection:** Internally uses the proven `Permit2RpcManager` logic:
  - Tests RPCs from `src/rpc-whitelist.json` for latency, sync status, and
    Permit2 bytecode.
  - Prioritizes selection: `ok` > `wrong_bytecode` > `syncing`.
  - Selects the fastest within each priority tier.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Automatically routes requests through the optimal
  available endpoint and transparently handles fallback if an endpoint fails.
- **Server-Side Caching:** Uses Deno KV to cache test results, improving
  performance for subsequent requests without relying on browser storage.

## 3. Target Users

- **Frontend dApp Developers:** Primarily benefits developers building
  browser-based applications who need reliable, performant, and CORS-compliant
  access to EVM chains.
- **Developers needing a simple RPC proxy:** Anyone who wants to abstract away
  RPC management behind a simple HTTP endpoint.

## 4. User Experience Goals (for the _end-user_ of the dApp using this proxy)

- **Responsiveness:** Faster dApp interactions due to optimized RPC selection
  and server-side caching.
- **Reliability:** Fewer transaction failures or errors caused by unreliable
  public RPCs.
- **Seamlessness:** Users are unaware of the underlying RPC complexity; the dApp
  simply works.

## 5. User Experience Goals (for the _developer_ using this proxy)

- **Simplicity:** Easy integration via a single HTTP endpoint format or the
  optional client SDK (`@ubiquity-dao/permit2-rpc-client`).
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Eliminates the need for frontend CORS workarounds,
  RPC management logic, and manual `fetch` calls (when using the SDK).
- **Improved Performance:** Leverages server-side intelligence for optimal RPC
  routing and supports batch requests.
- **Reliability:** Offloads RPC fallback complexity to the service.
