# Progress: Permit2 RPC Monorepo (Server + Client)

## 1. Current Status (April 1, 2025)

- **Phase:** Monorepo Refactor & Client SDK Implementation Complete / Documentation Finalization
- **Overall Progress:** ~100% (Monorepo structure established, Deno server migrated and enhanced, client SDK created and tested locally, documentation updated)

## 2. What Works

- **Monorepo Structure:**
    - Project organized into `packages/permit2-rpc-server` and `packages/permit2-rpc-client`.
    - Root `package.json` configured for workspaces.
- **Server Package (`packages/permit2-rpc-server`):**
    - Deno server (`src/deno-server.ts`) runs locally (`deno task start --unstable-kv`).
    - Handles single and batch JSON-RPC requests via `POST /rpc/{chainId}`.
    - Implements CORS.
    - Uses core logic (`Permit2RpcManager`, `RpcSelector`, etc.) for RPC selection/fallback.
    - Uses Deno KV for caching (`src/cache-manager.ts`), respecting `--unstable-kv` flag.
    - Caching can be disabled via `DISABLE_RPC_CACHE` env var for testing.
    - Loads whitelist from `rpc-whitelist.json`.
    - `deno.jsonc` provides tasks for start, dev, lint, fmt, test (test needs implementation).
    - Unused `viem` dependency and `contract-utils.ts` removed.
- **Client SDK Package (`packages/permit2-rpc-client`):**
    - Basic SDK implemented (`src/client.ts`) with `createRpcClient` and `request` method.
    - Builds successfully using `bun run build`.
    - Integration tests (`src/client.test.ts`) using `bun test` pass when run against the local server (`bun run test:client:local` from root).
    - `package.json` configured for publishing to npm.
- **Deployment (Server):**
    - GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deno-deploy.yml`) configured for Deno Deploy, pointing to the server package.
    - Manual deployment script (`scripts/manual-deploy.sh`) available and optimized.
- **Root Configuration:**
    - Scripts available for managing submodules and whitelist (`submodule:*`, `chainlist:*`, `whitelist:*`).
    - Scripts available for running client tests (`test`, `test:client:local`, `test:client:remote`) and manual deployment (`deploy:manual`).
- **Documentation:**
    - Root `README.md` explains monorepo.
    - Package `README.md` files created.
    - `docs/*` files updated to reflect current architecture.

## 3. Completed Tasks (Recent)

- ✅ **Monorepo Restructure:** Created `packages/` structure, moved server, created client package skeleton.
- ✅ **Server Batch Support:** Implemented batch request handling in `deno-server.ts`.
- ✅ **Deno KV Fix:** Added `--unstable-kv` flag to server tasks.
- ✅ **Server Import Fixes:** Corrected `rpc-whitelist.json` import paths.
- ✅ **Server Cleanup:** Removed unused `viem` dependency and `contract-utils.ts`.
- ✅ **Client SDK Implementation:** Created basic client code and build setup.
- ✅ **Client SDK Testing:** Added integration tests using `bun test`.
- ✅ **Local Testing Workflow:** Configured server and client scripts to allow local testing (`test:client:local`), including option to disable cache.
- ✅ **Documentation Update:** Updated all `docs/*` files and `.clinerules`.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- **Server Tests:** No automated tests implemented for the Deno server package itself (`deno task test` is a placeholder).
- **Client Tests:** Integration tests currently rely on specific results (like WXDAI balance) which might change; could be made more robust. Test coverage could be expanded.
- **TypeScript Errors (Editor):** Persistent TS errors related to Deno globals may appear in some editor environments but don't block execution.

## 5. Next Steps / Future Considerations

- **Server Testing:** Implement Deno tests for the server logic.
- **Client SDK Refinement:** Add features like automatic batching, typed helpers, more tests.
- **Publishing:** Publish `@ubiquity/permit2-rpc-client` to npm.
- **Abuse Prevention:** Implement CORS origin restrictions or API keys on the deployed server.
- **Whitelist Curation:** Ongoing maintenance of `rpc-whitelist.json` is important.
