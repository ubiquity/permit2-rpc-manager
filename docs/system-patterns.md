# System Patterns: Permit2 RPC Manager Rewrite

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The Deno Deploy service acts as a proxy, utilizing the core RPC manager logic:

        F --> C
        E --> C
    end

    User[Browser/Client] -- POST /rpc/{chainId} --> A
    C --> Network[(External RPC Endpoints)]

## 2. Component Descriptions

- **HTTP Server (`deno-server.ts`):** The Deno entrypoint. Handles incoming HTTP
  requests (`POST /rpc/{chainId}`), parses single or batch JSON-RPC payloads,
  sets CORS headers, interacts with `Permit2RpcManager`, and proxies responses
  back to the client.
- **Permit2RpcManager:** The main logic class. Integrates other components.
  Exposes the `send` method (used internally by the server) for making RPC
  calls. Implements round-robin starting point selection and iterative fallback
  logic. Accepts configuration options (timeouts, logging, cache settings,
  initial RPC data, disableCache). Instantiates internal components like
  `CacheManager` and `ChainlistDataSource`.
- **Chainlist Data Source (`ChainlistDataSource`):** Loads the curated list of
  RPC endpoints from `src/rpc-whitelist.json` (or accepts initial data passed
  via `Permit2RpcManager` options). Provides the list of URLs for a given chain
  to the `RpcSelector`.
- **Latency Tester (`LatencyTester`):** Tests the response time and validity of
  whitelisted RPC endpoints when triggered by the `RpcSelector` (typically on
  cache miss/expiry).
  - _Optimization:_ Performs `eth_chainId` first, then `eth_getCode` (Permit2)
    and `eth_syncing`.
  - Returns detailed results (`ok`, `wrong_bytecode`, `syncing`, `timeout`,
    `http_error`, `rpc_error`, `network_error`).
- **Cache Manager (`CacheManager`):** Stores the detailed `LatencyTestResult`
  map for each chain using **Deno KV** for persistence. Accepts configuration
  for TTL and the KV key prefix.
- **RPC Selector (`RpcSelector`):** The core ranking logic unit.
  1. Provides `getRankedRpcList(chainId)` method.
  2. Checks `CacheManager` (Deno KV) for fresh latency data.
  3. If cache is stale/invalid, triggers `LatencyTester` (using a locking
     mechanism).
  4. Updates cache with new test results.
  5. Filters out RPCs with error statuses.
  6. Sorts usable RPCs based on status priority (`ok` > `wrong_bytecode` >
     `syncing`) then latency.
  7. Returns the final sorted list of usable RPC URLs to `Permit2RpcManager`.

## 3. Key Design Patterns

- **Proxy Pattern:** The Deno server acts as a proxy, forwarding requests to the
  best available upstream RPC.
- **Ranking Strategy:** The `RpcSelector` ranks usable RPCs using a compound
  strategy (status priority then latency).
- **Round-Robin Load Distribution:** The `Permit2RpcManager` selects the
  _starting_ RPC for each new request in a round-robin fashion to distribute
  load.
- **Iterative Fallback:** The `Permit2RpcManager.send` method iterates through
  the entire ranked list upon failure.
- **Caching:** Uses Deno KV via `CacheManager` to store latency test results.
- **Modular Design:** Core logic components remain focused on distinct
  responsibilities.

## 4. Data Flow (Simplified Request via Proxy)

1. Client sends `POST /rpc/{chainId}` request with a single or batch JSON-RPC
   payload to the Deno Deploy service URL.
2. `deno-server.ts` receives the request, parses `chainId` and the payload
   (detecting single vs. batch).
3. For each request in the payload (or the single request), it calls
   `manager.send(chainId, method, params)`. Batch requests are typically
   processed concurrently using `Promise.allSettled` or similar.
4. For each `send` call, `Permit2RpcManager` asks
   `rpcSelector.getRankedRpcList(chainId)`.
5. `RpcSelector` checks `CacheManager` (Deno KV).
   - If cache is valid, returns cached ranked list.
   - If cache is invalid:
     - Triggers `LatencyTester.testRpcUrls` (with locking).
     - `LatencyTester` performs checks.
     - Results are used to rank usable RPCs.
     - `CacheManager` (Deno KV) is updated.
     - The ranked list is returned.
6. `Permit2RpcManager` determines its _starting_ RPC using round-robin.
7. It enters its iterative loop:
   - Attempts `executeRpcCall` with the current RPC URL.
   - If successful, returns the result.
   - If it fails, tries the next RPC.
8. `deno-server.ts` collects the result(s) or error(s) for each request.
9. `deno-server.ts` constructs a single or batch JSON-RPC response and sends it
   back to the client with CORS headers.
